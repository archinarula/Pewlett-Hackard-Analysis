## Overview of Analysis
This project is about analysis of employee data of Pewlett-Hackard for their aging employees  born between 1952-1955 who will soon retire from the company and to help Pewlett management understand if they have enough mentors available to train other employees to take up these open positions. SQL queries were created to retreive data using various tables for the databases and with use of Joins, Distinct, Count, group and Order, good data was retrieved.

### Purpose
The purpose of this data analysis is to identify the retiring employees by title/roles and availability for mentorship progream which will help Pewlett-Hackard to plan to fill the role gaps due to so many employees retiring across the organization.

## Results

### Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types

### Pyber Summary Dataframe- key highlights:
Based on the summary dataframe and also the multiple line chart the key highlights for the difference of rides between period of Jan -April 2019 are:
- Rural cities had highest average fare per ride and per driver
- Rural cities had lowest number of total rides or total drivers
- Urban cities had the highest total rides (approx 171% more) and Suburban (approx. 88% more) 
- Urban cities had the highest total number of drivers and total fares
- Urban cities had the highest total fares and total drivers than Rural 
- Urban cities had the lowest average fare per ride or per driver

## Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
- The drop in the number of ride usage in the rural cities within the months of January to April, 2019 could be due to the low number of available rides and drivers in those cities and allocating more rides & drivers to the rural cities will most likely reduce average fare per ride & driver which will boost ride affordability. 
- The Urban cities can also benefit from more ride allocation within the months of January to April as this will help meet the demands for rides in those months , increase revenue and enhance affordability.
- Mid Feb- Marc end showed peaks in fare for all city types so maybe some additional data around demographic of riders can be gathered around that period to understand what led to spikes and promotional activities for riders can be customized to enhance usage during this period.
